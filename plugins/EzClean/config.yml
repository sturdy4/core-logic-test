# EzClean configuration has moved!
#
# The plugin now loads its settings from multiple files within the EzClean data folder:
#   - death-chests.yml controls the optional death chest feature.
#   - cleaners/*.yml contains individual cleaner profiles (e.g. cleaners/default.yml).
#
# This placeholder file remains in the jar for compatibility but is no longer read by
# EzClean during startup. Remove it safely or keep it as a reference for the new layout.
